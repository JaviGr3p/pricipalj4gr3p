title: Hackthebox Titanic Writeup
slug: hackthebox-titanic-writeup
description: This walk through details the process of exploiting the Titanic machine on HackTheBox. By enumerating services on Port 80 and Port 22, we discover a Gitea instance on a subdomain. An LFI (Local File Inclusion) vulnerability exposes Gitea’s database, enabling us to retrieve credentials for a user named “developer.” After logging in via SSH, we uncover a script that uses a vulnerable version of ImageMagick, which can be exploited to gain root access.
